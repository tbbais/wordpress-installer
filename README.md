# WordPress Installer VSCode Extension

## About

**WordPress Installer** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help developers quickly set up a WordPress environment. It simplifies the process by automating tasks like downloading and extracting WordPress and configuring the necessary filesâ€”all from within VSCode.

No more manual downloads or switching to the terminal! With just a few commands, you can have a fresh WordPress installation ready to go.

## Features

- **Automatic WordPress Download**: Fetches and installs the latest version of WordPress.
- **Custom Configuration**: Prompts for necessary information (such as database details) and automatically configures the `wp-config.php` file.
- **Simple Setup Process**: User-friendly prompts to get WordPress installed and configured quickly.
- **No External Tools Required**: Everything works seamlessly within VSCode, no need for command-line utilities like `wp-cli`.
